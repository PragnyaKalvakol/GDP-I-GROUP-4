- Firebase Hosting provides fast and secure hosting for your web app.
- Firebase Hosting is production-grade web content hosting for developers.
- Can also pair Firebase Hosting with Cloud Functions or Cloud Run to build and host microservices on Firebase.

- Firebase can be hosted on different platforms like:
a)web, 
b)android and 
c)iOS.



- With a single command, you can quickly deploy web apps and serve both static and dynamic content to a global CDN (content delivery network).
- For setting up sdk in our web application CDN is used.
- From CDN we can load firebase JavaScript sdk libraries. 

Key Capabilities:
a) Serve content over a secure connection.
b) Host static and dynamic content plus microservices.
c) Deliver content fast
d) Emulate and even share your changes before going live
e) Deploy new versions with one command



How it works:
- Firebase Hosting is built for the modern web developer. 
- Websites and apps are more powerful than ever with the rise of front-end JavaScript frameworks like Angular and static generator tools like Jekyll.
- Using the Firebase CLI, you deploy files from local directories on your computer to our Hosting servers.
- You can also view and test your changes before going live.
- For serving your content, Firebase offers several domain and subdomain options:
By default, every Firebase project has subdomains at no cost on the web.app and firebaseapp.com domains. 
These two sites serve the same deployed content and configuration.
- Deploy your site
- Link to a Firebase Web App
