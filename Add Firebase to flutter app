Step 1: 

Install the required command line tools
- If you haven't already, install the Firebase CLI.
- Log into Firebase using your Google account by running the following command:
firebase login
- Install the FlutterFire CLI by running the following command from any directory:
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli





Step 2:
Configure your apps to use Firebase

- Use the FlutterFire CLI to configure your Flutter apps to connect to Firebase.
- From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to start the app configuration workflow:
flutterfire configure



Step 3:
Initialize Firebase in your app

- From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to install the core plugin:
flutter pub add firebase_core
- From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to ensure that your Flutter app's Firebase configuration is up-to-date:
flutterfire configure
- In your lib/main.dart file, import the Firebase core plugin and the configuration file you generated earlier:
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';
- Also in your lib/main.dart file, initialize Firebase using the DefaultFirebaseOptions object exported by the configuration file:
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
- Rebuild your Flutter application:
flutter run
