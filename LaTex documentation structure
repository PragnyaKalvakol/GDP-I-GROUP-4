The main point of writing a text is to convey ideas, information, or knowledge to the reader. The reader will understand the text better if these ideas are well-structured, and will see and feel this structure much better if the typographical form reflects the logical and semantic structure of the content.

Titles, Authors and others
\title{…}		 \author{…}
\footnote{…}

\maketitle  - Display Title and Author
\tableofcontents - generates TOC
\listoftables - generates LOT
\listoffigures - generates LOF

Labels
\label{marker} - Marker in document.
\pageref{marker} - Displays page no. of marker.
\ref{marker} - Displays section location of marker.

Itemise
Use either enumerate, itemize or description.
see handout for example.

\pagenumbering{num_style} - Specifies the style of page numbers. 
Possible values of num_style are:
arabic Arabic numerals
roman Lowercase roman numerals
Roman Uppercase roman numerals
alph Lowercase letters
Alph Uppercase letters

- \title{text} The \title command declares text to be the title. Use \\ to tell LaTeX where to start a new line in a long title.
- \textwidth is the normal width of the text on a page. It should generally be changed only in the preamble.
- \linewidth is the width of lines in the current environment. Normally equal to \textwidth, it may be different within an environment such as list or quote environments.
- \location{address} - This modifies your organization's standard address. This only appears if the firstpage pagestyle is selected.
- Footnotes can be produced in one of two ways. They can be produced with one command, the \footnote command. They can also be produced with two commands, the \footnotemark and the \footnotetext commands. See the specific commands, below, for information on why you would use one rather than another.
- The first thing LaTeX does when processing ordinary text is to translate your input file into a string of glyphs and spaces. To produce a printed document, this string must be broken into lines, and these lines must be broken into pages. In some environments, you do the line breaking yourself with the \\ command, but LaTeX usually does it for you.
Commands for line and page breaks:
\hyphenation
\cleardoublepage
\clearpage
\newline
\linebreak
\nolinebreak
\newpage
\pagebreak
\nopagebreak
- The following characters play a special role in LaTeX and are called special printing characters, or simply special characters.# $ % & ~ _ ^ \ { }
\underline{text} - The \underline command causes the argument text to be underlined. This command can be used in math mode, paragraph mode, and LR mode.

Description - The description environment is used to make labeled lists. The label is bold face and flushed right. The text of the \item command is indented.
Typical usage is for descriptive lists or lists of definitions; the label is then the name of the item being described or defined.
\begin{description}
 \item[label] First item
 \item[label] Second item
 ....
 \end{description}

Importing graphics into a LATEX document needs an add-on package which provides the commands and features required to include external graphics files.
