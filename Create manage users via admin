The Firebase Admin SDK provides an API for managing your Firebase Authentication users with elevated privileges. 
The admin user management API gives you the ability to programmatically complete the following tasks from a secure server environment.

- Create new users without any throttling or rate limiting.
- Look up users by different criteria such as uid, email or phone number.
- List all the users of a specified project in batches.
- Access user metadata including account creation date and last sign-in date.
- Delete users without requiring their existing password
