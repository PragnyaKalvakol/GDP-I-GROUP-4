Add Firebase to your JavaScript project

To use the Firebase JavaScript SDK in web app for end-user access, for example, in a Node.js desktop or IoT application steps are as follows:

Step 1: Create a Firebase project and register your app

- Before you can add Firebase to your JavaScript app, you need to create a Firebase project and register your app with that project. 
- When you register your app with Firebase, you'll get a Firebase configuration object that you'll use to connect your app with your Firebase project resources.


Step 2: Install the SDK and initialize Firebase

- Install Firebase using npm:
npm install firebase

- Initialize Firebase in your app and create a Firebase App object:
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  //...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
