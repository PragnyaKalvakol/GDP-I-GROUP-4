#### Introduction to Left Over On Wheels (LOOW)
<p>
In highly populated countries, food wastage is a disturbing issue. High standard of living has resulted in the wastage of food because of quick changes in habits and lifestyle. Instead of wasting these things we can put them in use by donating them to various organizations such as orphanages or old age homes. The product is a android application which aims to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation.
 </p>

#### Softwares used in this project (LOOW)
<p> Firebase, Power Automate, Microsoft Power Virtual Agents, HTML, CSS, Android studio</p>


#### Features of the Application

<ol>1. Registrations for both end users<br>
    2. Use of a chatbot to provide assistance<br>
    3. When food becomes readily accessible,Â popup notifications will be sent to the receiver.<br>
    4. Users can donate funds.<br></ol>

##### Andriod Studio
Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. Based on the powerful code editor and developer tools from IntelliJ IDEA , Android Studio offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android apps.

##### Project Structure in Andriod Studio
Each project in Android Studio contains one or more modules with source code files and resource files. The types of modules include:
- Android app modules
- Library modules
- Google App Engine modules

###### Flutter commands

- Flutter doctor - This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. Check the output carefully for other        software you might need to install or further tasks to perform.
- pub get - This command gets all the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml file in the current working directory, as well as their transitive dependencies.
- pub upgrade - To get the latest versions of all dependencies used by your Dart app.

##### Why APK?
<p>While developing an Android app, you would usually run it on a physical device or an emulator. If you want to share it with someone for their feedback, you would share an APK that can easily be installed on any Android device.</p>

##### How you can extract an APK file using Android Studio?
1. In the Android menu, go to Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK (s) > Build APK(s).
2. Android Studio will start building the APK for you. Once done, a pop-up on the bottom right will notify you of its completion. Click the âlocateâ button in this dialog.
3. The âlocateâ button should open File Explorer with the debug folder open that contains a file called âapp-debug.apkâ.
4. Thatâs it. Rename this file and share!

##### Power Virtual agent

<p>Microsoft Power Virtual Agent (PVA) is a Microsoft platform for no-code and citizen development of powerful bots. It offers a low-code platform for Building AI-driven chatbots which puts conversational AI, automated customer service, and intelligent virtual assistants within reach for many businesses. It also bridges the gap between your âlow code developersâ and âpro-code developers,â further expediting your bot building process.</p>

#### Importance of PVA
<p>Power Virtual Agents enables anyone in your organization to create AI-powered bots that can chat with users about specific topics. They can answer routine questions, resolve common issues, or automate tasks that take up valuable customer or employee time.</p>

- Developing in Flutter is very fast and efficient.

##### Disadvantages of flutter
- Flutter-based apps are not supported by browsers as of now. This means no web apps.
- While Flutter is popular, it has not been around long enough to have a huge resource base. Therefore, your team will need to write a lot of stuff from scratch.
- Dart is not a popular language and if you want to work with Flutter you will have to learn how to use it.

#### Dart

<p>Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform.It is an open source and scalable programming language with many built-in libraries.Dart can be extensively used to create single-page applications.</p>

##### Importance of Dart
<p>Dart is a client-optimized language for creating quick programs on any environment. Its objective is to provide the highest effective software program for inter construction along with a versatile executing environment platform for application architectures. Dart is most widely used in single page application like web application, website.</p>

##### Dart Advantages
-  Easy to learn

</p>

#### Widgets
<p>Widgets enable users to interact with an Android Studio application page. There are various kinds of widgets, such as Buttons and TextViews. To see all the widgets at your disposal, create a new application project called âWidgetsâ and select "empty activity". Call your activity âMainActivityâ.</p>
<p> The ability to customize a home screen is greatly aided by widgets. They could be thought of as "at-a-glance" representations of an app's most crucial information and features that are available directly from the user's home screen. The quantity of information a widget contains can be customized by users by moving widgets across the panels on their home screen and, if supported, by resizing them.</p>

##### Pros of widgets
- Widgets are simple, easy-to-use software applications intended for one or more platforms. 
- Serving as independent applications, widgets can easily be embedded into the body of websites.

<img width="375" alt="Architecture of LOOW" src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98135573/194678006-d11dbf36-6dd1-4855-8141-1c6a484921ad.png">

####  Tab bars in Android application
<p>A tab bar appears at the bottom of the application screen and allows you to quickly move from one section to another in the application. This is the most popular navigation structure for mobile applications. It usually contains between 4 and 5 tabs.</p>

#### App bars in Android Application
<p>When using fragments, the app bar can be implemented as an ActionBar that is owned by the host activity or a toolbar within your fragment's layout. Ownership of the app bar varies depending on the needs of your app.</p>

#### Register 
<p>It is the page which allows the user to type in the details like name,password,emailid,contact details and location details.
Our basic register page has fields like name, email, password, confirm password, phone and location</p> 

##### Sessions
<p>Session help you when want to store user data outside your application, so that when the next time user use your application, you can easily get back his details and perform accordingly. This can be done in many ways. But the most easiest and nicest way of doing this is through Shared Preferences.<p>
<p>Shared Preferences allow you to save and retrieve data in the form of key,value pair. In order to use shared preferences, you have to call a method getSharedPreferences() that returns a SharedPreference instance pointing to the file that contains the values of preferences.</p>
SharedPreferences sharedpreferences = getSharedPreferences(MyPREFERENCES, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);

##### Importance of sessions
<p>Sessions can be analyzed in a way that reveals how users truly interact with an app. For example, session data can determine the average length of time users spend on an app as well as the time of day users are most likely to engage with a particular app. By combining analysis of session metadata (e.g., session length) with usage data (e.g., tracking certain in-app events) and then analyzing behavior across a user base, app businesses can identify opportunities or problems within their apps that can be optimized for improved performance down the line.</p>

##### Examples of sessions
- E-commerce apps
- Mid-core game developers 
- Social media apps

##### Advantages of sessions
- It stores user states and data to all over the application.
- Easy mechanism to implement and we can store any kind of object.
- Stores every user data separately.
- Session is secure and transparent from user because session object is stored on the server.

##### Disadvantages of sessions
- Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory.
- Overhead involved in serializing and De-Serializing session data because in case of StateServer and SQLServer session mode we need to serialize the object before store.
##### How an app maintain its session?
<p> To maintain state, the mobile app must first authenticate the user through the backend. In response to successful authentication, the server issues a session cookie to the mobile app. The mobile app adds this cookie to all future service transactions between the mobile app and the server.</p>
