#### Introduction to Left Over On Wheels (LOOW)
<p>
In highly populated countries, food wastage is a disturbing issue. High standard of living has resulted in the wastage of food because of quick changes in habits and lifestyle. Instead of wasting these things we can put them in use by donating them to various organizations such as orphanages or old age homes. The product is a android application which aims to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation.
 </p>

#### Softwares used in this project (LOOW)
<p> Firebase, Power Automate, Microsoft Power Virtual Agents, HTML, CSS, Android studio</p>


#### Features of the Application

<ol>1. Registrations for both end users<br>
    2. Use of a chatbot to provide assistance<br>
    3. When food becomes readily accessible,Â popup notifications will be sent to the receiver.<br>
    4. Users can donate funds.<br></ol>

##### Why APK?
<p>While developing an Android app, you would usually run it on a physical device or an emulator. If you want to share it with someone for their feedback, you would share an APK that can easily be installed on any Android device.</p>

##### How you can extract an APK file using Android Studio?
1. In the Android menu, go to Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK (s) > Build APK(s).
2. Android Studio will start building the APK for you. Once done, a pop-up on the bottom right will notify you of its completion. Click the âlocateâ button in this dialog.
3. The âlocateâ button should open File Explorer with the debug folder open that contains a file called âapp-debug.apkâ.
4. Thatâs it. Rename this file and share!
