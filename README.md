#### Introduction to Left Over On Wheels (LOOW)
<p>
In highly populated countries, food wastage is a disturbing issue. High standard of living has resulted in the wastage of food because of quick changes in habits and lifestyle. Instead of wasting these things we can put them in use by donating them to various organizations such as orphanages or old age homes. The product is a android application which aims to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation.
 </p>

#### Softwares used in this project (LOOW)
<p> Firebase,Firestore,Firebase Authentication, Power Automate, Microsoft Power Virtual Agents, HTML, CSS, Android studio,Flutter,Dart</p>


#### Features of the Application

<ol>1. Registrations for both end users.<br>
    2. Use of a chatbot to provide assistance.<br>
    3. Location can be fetched directly using google maps API.<br>
    4. Users can donate funds.<br>
    5. Toast message will be displayed once the order is added to cart or placed.<br>
    6. Email will be sent via chatbot for assistance.<br>
    7. Admin should be authenticated using firebase. <br>
    8. Admin will be able to manage the users.
    
</ol>
  
 
 #### How it works
 <p> The proposed application is android based application, developed on Android Studio using HTML and CSS which requires internet connection and will provide a platform for donating leftover food to all needy people/organizations.Through this application restaurant  can send the leftover food items as per their capacity and the application also allows organizations to put up their requests,if any.<br>
</p>

#### Interface Requirements
##### User Interface
<p> The interface shall be android based allowing user to access the system. This designand layout will be very clear and interactive to the user. There will be a proper collection of GUI interface, which will provide better look. <br> 
  </p>
  
##### Hardware Interface
<p> The hardware requirement at the user end is really simple and the website can also run on the hardware that can run a basic simple browser. The application will run on any system with basic requirement. </p>

##### Software Interface
<p> During our system development, we design both static and dynamic website interfaces. The application software will run on operating system Window8, windows 10 with additional requirements and also in android mobiles. </p>

##### Communication Interface
<p> The application supports Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox web browsers.</P>

##### Andriod Studio
Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. Based on the powerful code editor and developer tools from IntelliJ IDEA , Android Studio offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android apps.

##### Project Structure in Andriod Studio
Each project in Android Studio contains one or more modules with source code files and resource files. The types of modules include:
- Android app modules
- Library modules
- Google App Engine modules

###### Flutter commands

- Flutter doctor - This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. Check the output carefully for other        software you might need to install or further tasks to perform.
- pub get - This command gets all the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml file in the current working directory, as well as their transitive dependencies.
- pub upgrade - To get the latest versions of all dependencies used by your Dart app.

##### Why APK?
<p>While developing an Android app, you would usually run it on a physical device or an emulator. If you want to share it with someone for their feedback, you would share an APK that can easily be installed on any Android device.</p>

##### How you can extract an APK file using Android Studio?
1. In the Android menu, go to Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK (s) > Build APK(s).
2. Android Studio will start building the APK for you. Once done, a pop-up on the bottom right will notify you of its completion. Click the ‘locate’ button in this dialog.
3. The ‘locate’ button should open File Explorer with the debug folder open that contains a file called “app-debug.apk”.
4. That’s it. Rename this file and share!

##### Power Virtual agent

<p>Microsoft Power Virtual Agent (PVA) is a Microsoft platform for no-code and citizen development of powerful bots. It offers a low-code platform for Building AI-driven chatbots which puts conversational AI, automated customer service, and intelligent virtual assistants within reach for many businesses. It also bridges the gap between your “low code developers” and “pro-code developers,” further expediting your bot building process.</p>

#### Importance of PVA
<p>Power Virtual Agents enables anyone in your organization to create AI-powered bots that can chat with users about specific topics. They can answer routine questions, resolve common issues, or automate tasks that take up valuable customer or employee time.</p>

##### Features of Power Virtual Agent

- Build bots quickly and easily
- Deploy across channels and languages
- Scale securely with centralized management
- Improve your bots over time

##### Power Automate
<p> Power Automate, formerly Microsoft Flow, is an online tool within the Microsoft 365 applications and add-ins, used for the creation of automated workflows between apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, and collect data.</p>


##### Flutter
<p>Flutter is framework created by google. </p>
<p>There are many advantages of Flutter as a cross platform mobile development framework, including the ability to create web applications that have a native look and feel on both Android and iOS devices, reduced development time and costs, and increased flexibility.</p>

#### Dart

<p>Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform.It is an open source and scalable programming language with many built-in libraries.Dart can be extensively used to create single-page applications.</p>

##### Importance of Dart
<p>Dart is a client-optimized language for creating quick programs on any environment. Its objective is to provide the highest effective software program for inter construction along with a versatile executing environment platform for application architectures. Dart is most widely used in single page application like web application, website.</p>

##### Firebase

Firebase is a set of hosting services for any type of application. It offers NoSQL and real-time hosting of databases, content, social authentication, and notifications, or services, such as a real-time communication server. Firebase provides detailed documentation and cross-platform SDKs to help you build and ship apps on Android, iOS, the web, C++, and Unity.

##### Firebase Features
<p>Developers can create iOS, Android, and Web apps using the Google-sponsored application development platform known as Firebase. Tools are available from Firebase for monitoring analytics, reporting and resolving app errors, as well as developing marketing and product experiments.</p>
