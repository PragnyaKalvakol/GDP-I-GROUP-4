#### Introduction to Left Over On Wheels (LOOW)
<p>
In highly populated countries, food wastage is a serious and disturbing issue. High standard of living has resulted in the wastage of food because of quick changes in habits and lifestyle. Instead of wasting these things we can put them in use by donating them to various organizations such as orphanages or old age homes. The product is a web application which aims to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation.
 </p>

#### Softwares used in this project (LOOW)
<p> Database, Javascript, html,CSS, Anroid studio, azure services, powerapps are used in this project.</p>


#### Features of the Application

<ol>1. Registrations for both end users<br>
    2. Use of a chatbot to provide assistance<br>
    3. When food becomes readily accessible,  popup notifications will be sent to the receiver.<br>
    4. Users can track their food using the application's geolocation features.<br>
    5. Users can donate funds. </ol>

#### User Classes and Characteristics
<p> Our application hopes to draw on three main user groups. The Admin, User and Volunteer have their own individual login id and password.</p>
<p> The three main user groups are:<br>
    (A) Admin: Maps the users and volunteer databases and checks the orders and confirms it. And takes the delivery report.<br>
    (B) User: Posts the availability of the food.<br>
    (C) Volunteer: Goes,picks up the food posted by the user and delivers it to the needy.</p>
