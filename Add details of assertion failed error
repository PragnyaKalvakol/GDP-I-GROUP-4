Assertion Error in Android Studio when trying to compile the working project

<p> An assertion statement specifies a condition that you expect to hold true at some particular point in your program. 
If that condition does not hold true, the assertion fails, execution of your program is interrupted, and this dialog box appears.</p>

<p> I'm working on a flutter web project ,when i run in localhost it is working fine but after deploying in firebase it is showing white blank page
