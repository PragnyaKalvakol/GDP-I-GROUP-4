\section{\textbf{ABSTRACT}}
Our society frequently struggles with food waste. Managing food waste is vital because it can increase our long-term sustainability of both the climate and the economy. We have recognized the use of digital technology to lessen food waste management and have developed an android mobile application that enables restaurants to donate and share their leftovers to needy people. Users of this application can sign up, sign in, display, add, and remove items from their carts as well as log out and view their items. Firebase storage and a real-time database are both used by this application. Any user can be able to see the availability of food which was updated by the restaurants. And they can request food, which is available for pick-up by a volunteer.
Centralized computing is being forced onto the software industry. In recent years, mobile phone apps have become increasingly popular. Android is currently used on countless thousands of android platforms in over 190 countries around the globe, making it the most widely used mobile platform. The most widely used mobile platform is Android, and its user base is growing quickly because of the nearly 1 million new Android devices that are bought daily by users who use them right away to access a variety of digital applications and material, including games and applications. As a result, we used Android Studio to create the "LOOW App" android application, which basically forms a bridge between restaurants and orphanages.
In this we have used Flutter, which is Google's UI toolkit for producing stunning, natively built applications from a single codebase for Android, the web, and desktops. Google's mobile app development platform is called Firebase. An end-to-end development environment, a speedier time to market for developing apps, and scalable infrastructure are some of its advantages. For developing, testing, deploying, and managing apps and services through Google-managed data centers, Google launched their Firebase cloud computing service.
Through this app, we can aid poor communities or needy organizations in their fight against malnutrition and hotels to donate food to those communities. We can put these items to use by giving them to charities or organizations that support the less fortunate, such as orphanages or old age homes.
The product is an android application that tries to create a connection between restaurants and charity houses or needy households to facilitate the donation of extra food. Additionally, volunteers who support our effort assist in transporting food from restaurants to orphans. People who want to provide money to those in need can use this program to do so by using PayPal.

\section{\textbf{INTRODUCTION}}

   The approximately of 643 million meals' worth of food, or 390,000 tons, might be diverted from eateries' regular use to recovery each year. There are legal liability protections for food donations, but education is necessary to spread knowledge of and appreciation for the federal Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, which shields both donors and recipients from legal responsibility. Businesses that qualify for expanded deductions under the 2015 Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act may be eligible. The kind of nourishment a restaurant serves affects the volume of contributions in any program for recovering food.

An average of one pound of food is wasted by Americans every day, or 150,000 tons. According to study, each day, Americans squander around a pounds of foods, with persons who eat healthy diets high in fruits and veggies among the most wasteful.

In the US, 119 billion pounds of food are wasted annually. That works out to 130 billion meals and more than $\$$408 billion value of food wasted annually. Surprisingly, 40$\%$ of the food produced in America is wasted.

\subsection{Problem statement}
Food waste is a concerning problem in densely populated nations. There is plenty of evidence in the form of landfills, trash cans, and city streets. Many meals are wasted at weddings, canteens, restaurants, social engagements, and family events. Food waste is a sign of numerous economic issues in addition to hunger or environmental degradation. Food, clothing, and other items are being wasted because of the rapid shifts in lifestyle and inhabitation. We may put these resources to use by donating items to local entities like orphanages, senior living facilities, etc. The concept is an android based application that intends to create a connection connecting restaurants and nonprofit foundations or impoverished families to facilitate the distribution of leftover food.

\subsection{Motivation}
Food is wasted at each level of food manufacturing and distribution, from cultivators to loaders and exporters, manufactures to consumers, and even in our own households. Approximately 39$\%$ including all food waste, or 42 billion pounds total wasted food, occurs in our homes. While around 61$\%$ of total food scraps, or 66 billion pounds of leftover waste, is composed of business food waste. Reduced food loss on fields, in restaurant work, industry, and commerce are the main goals of Food Banks in America.

\subsection{Scope}
Many individuals and institutions want to contribute stuff to charities that are in need. Additionally, many charities seek to solicit donations of various items they need, such as food, clothing, food grains, cutlery, etc. However, there is no resource accessible via which they can meet their needs. As a result, an android-based application has been created that permits users to give food products according to their ability and to post requests for any items that charities may need.

\subsection{Outline}
The primary objective of the project is to create an android application that enables users to give as much food as they can rather than waste it. The goal of this effort is to provide food to those who are hungry.
\section{\textbf{SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION:}}

\subsection{Purpose:}

We have developed android based application has been developed through which people can donate food items as per their capacity and the application also allows organizations to put up their requests, if any. 

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\subsection{ Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions:}


The application is targeted in two ways, the user who is donating the food and the person organization that is claiming the food. There will be Admin, Restaurant, Orphanage and Volunteer. 

Restaurant user: Posts the availability of the food. 

Volunteer: Goes, picks up the food posted by the user and delivers it to the needy. 

Admin: Maps the restaurant users and orphanage databases and checks the orders and confirms it. And takes the delivery report.

Orphanage: Takes the food delivered by volunteer.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\subsection{Overall Description:}

\subsubsection{Product Perspective:}

The product aims at satisfying the requirements of needy organizations through donations over the net. The application shall ask the restaurant user to register its details into the application and then they can login and put-up items to donate. The main objectives of the proposed application include reduction in wastage of food.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\subsubsection{Product Functions:}

The application has main page, from which the rest of the features or functions can be accessed. These main features as listed are: 

Adminâ€™s area.

Restaurant Users area. 

Orphanage area.
