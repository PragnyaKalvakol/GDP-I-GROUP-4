Solution 1
Here is a better solution so you do not have to import the project again.

Go to: File > Invalidate Caches/Restart and select Invalidate and Restart

Solution 2
Just remove .idea files from project. And import project again.

Solution 3
Or update The SDK Build Tools, in Android SDK.

Tried with this solution
> open your index.html > remove "/" from <base href="/"> 

Try to remove that line <base href="/"> and run in debug mode. If it works then "flutter build web" then deploy and if not working then, when the blank page is showing. Open the browser's console and check for any error. â€“ 

Try to modify file
webView.getSettings().setDomStorageEnabled(true)

try this in your manifest may be your problem should be solved

android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"


I'm trying to build a flutter web app. Everything works fine while developing locally on Windows 10, but when I build and deploy the app, it only works in my desktop Chrome browser.

Run flutter channel master.
Run flutter upgrade.
Run flutter config --enable-web.
Run flutter create mywebapp.
Run cd webapp.
Run flutter build web.
Deploy to server or host locally (e.g. cd build\web and `http-server).
Connect to  browser(Android/iOS).
